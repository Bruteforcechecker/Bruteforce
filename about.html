    <h1>Welcome to Bruteforce</h1>
    <p> Firstly let me give you a bit understanding about how the credit card invented 
        Credit cards were first introduced by Bank of America in the 1950s. They were initially known as the BankAmericard and were later renamed Visa in 1976. 
        
        Debit cards were introduced by Barclays Bank in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. They were called the Barclays Connect card and were the first debit card issued in the UK.
        
        But let's be real, these companies were just the first to market, not the first to develop them.
        
        The real innovator in credit card development was Frank McNamara who founded the Diners Club in 1950. It was the first credit card company in the world and the first to be issued to a large number of people.
        
        So, while Bank of America and Barclays Bank were the first to market credit and debit cards, Diners Club was the first to develop them. in the year 2000 Frank McNamara space Team Leaked the source code of how
